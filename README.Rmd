# A Naive 2022 Senate Forecast

I do not study elections.
I am not a forecaster.
So take what follows accordingly.

There are a number of people who have built sophisticated and probably quite fine election forecasting models.
I wanted to see something a little different.
How close can I get with a *very naive* forecasting model?
