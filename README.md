# A Naive 2022 Senate Forecast

I do not study elections. I am not a forecaster. So take what follows
accordingly.

There are a number of people who have built sophisticated and probably
quite fine election forecasting models. I wanted to see something a
little different. How close can I get with a *very naive* forecasting
model?
